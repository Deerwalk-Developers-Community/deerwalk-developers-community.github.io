These are the principles that all members of the Deerwalk Developers Community must adhere to.

# Build for Impact, Not Hype
We prioritize meaningful and practical open-source solutions that positively affect Nepali youth.
# Transparency and Openness
All our projects are open-source, fostering trust, learning, and innovation.
# Quality Over Quantity
We focus on creating robust, well-crafted software rather than chasing trends or vanity metrics.
# Learning by Building
Every project is a chance to learn, experiment, and grow, both as individuals and as a community.
# Community First
We value people over code, creating an inclusive environment that celebrates collaboration, creativity, and curiosity.
